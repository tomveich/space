# Sustainable biomaterials in the field of space engineering
The main research team at space.oli.cx managed to develop an adhesive substance from purified sap collected from <em>Ficus carica</em> trees.

## Dangers of handling biomaterials
While biomaterials might be more sustainable, the fact they are produced by living organisms raises an important question in terms of safety of their handling. Sap collected from the <em>Moraceae</em> family of plants (incl. <em>Ficus carica</em>) is known to irritate human skin, resulting in phytophotodermatitis when followed by exposure to ultraviolet light.
